                            Heat the oil in a deep frying pan, and tip in the mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon
                            as you go, until browned all over. Stir in the onion and pepper and cook for 8-10 mins until
                            softened. Tip in the tomatoes and Nando's PERi-BBQ sauce, and season. Simmer for 20-25 mins

                                <li>2 tbsp English mustard powder</li>
                                <li>1 tsp celery salt</li>

                                <li>4 racks baby back pork ribs (about 450g each)</li>
                                <li><strong>For the baste</strong></li>
                                <li>250ml yellow mustard</li>
                                <li>150ml cider vinegar</li>
                                <li>2 tbsp treacle</li>

                                <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                                <li>1-2 tbsp hot chilli sauce</li>
                                <li>2 tsp hot chilli powder</li>

                        <h5>Method</h5>
                        
                        <p class="card-text"><strong>STEP 1</strong>
                            <br>
                            Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Combine the sugar, paprika, mustard powder, celery salt
                            and garlic granules in a bowl, and rub all over the ribs. Place in 2 large roasting tins
                            with racks set inside (if you don't have racks, that's fine). Pour 150ml water into the
                            bottom of each tin, cover tightly with foil and roast for 3 hrs until nearly falling apart.
                            If your roasting tins are on different shelves, swap them over halfway through the cooking
                            time. Once cooked, remove and drain the cooking liquid.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Meanwhile, to make the baste, mix all the ingredients in a saucepan and cook for 10 mins,
                            stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>STEP 3</strong>
                            <br>
                            Heat an outdoor barbecue. Whether your grill is gas or charcoal, use low heat to barbecue
                            the ribs. Cook the ribs for 3-4 mins each side, brushing regularly with the baste, until
                            golden and sticky. Alternatively, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/ gas 7 and roast the ribs for
                            25-30 mins, turning the ribs over and rotating the tins halfway through the cooking time.

                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Method</h5>
                        <p class="card-text"><strong>STEP 1</strong>
                            <br>
                            Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 180C/ 160C fan/ gas 4.
                            Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin by putting a square piece of parchment paper or
                            foil on top of the tin base and then clipping the side on so the paper or foil is trapped
                            and any excess sticks out of the bottom.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>STEP 2</strong>
                            <br>
                            For the crust, melt 85g butter in a medium pan. Stir in 140g digestive biscuit crumbs and 1
                            tbsp golden caster or granulated sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened. Press the mixture
                            into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the
                            filling.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>STEP 3</strong>
                            <br>
                            For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 220C/ 200C fan/ gas 7. In a table top
                            mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat 900g full-fat soft cheese at medium-low speed
                            until creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer on low, gradually add 250g golden caster
                            sugar, then 3 tbsp plain flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and
                            the paddle twice. Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding 1½ tsp
                            vanilla extract, 2 tsp lemon zest and 1½ tsp lemon juice. Whisk in 3 large eggs and 1 yolk,
                            one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>STEP 4</strong>
                            <br>
                            Stir a 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml (just over ¾ of the
                            carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest).
                            Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.
                            Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in
                            the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth
                            as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 110C/ 90C fan/ gas ¼ and bake
                            for 45 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble.
                            Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or
                            leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The
                            cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>STEP 5</strong>
                            <br>
                            Combine the reserved soured cream with a 142ml carton soured cream, 1 tbsp golden caster
                            sugar and 2 tsp lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges.
                            Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Run a
                            round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side,
                            slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper
                            out from underneath.
